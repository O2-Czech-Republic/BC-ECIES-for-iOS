# iOS-compatible ECIES implementation in Java

This is a porting of Bouncy Castle's IES engine to provide compatibility with Apple's `SecKeyCreateEncryptedData`, specifically the ECIES algortihms provided by Apple's internal Common Crypto and Core Crypto libraries when using one of the `SecKeyAlgorithmECIESEncryptionCofactorVariableIV*` algorithms (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seckeyalgorithm).

Apple uses a secific implementation of ECIES which does not perform explicit message tagging, but instead uses an authenticated encryption (AEAD) variant of AES - AES-GCM. GCM (Galois/Counter mode) produces a message tag appended to the ciphertext similarly to other HMAC processes but allows for authentication data input.

## Cryptographic standards (based on iOS support)
#### Supported curves
- P-256 (secp256r1) only (other key sizes are not supported by Secure Enclave)

#### Supported KDF
- ANSI X9.63 KDF using the following message digest algorithms:
  - SHA1
  - SHA224
  - SHA256
  - SHA384
  - SHA512
  
#### Supported symmetric encryption scheme
- AES (GCM) using:
  - 128-bit key (for EC keypairs <= 256 bits) - first part of the KDF output
  - 16-byte nonce - second part of the KDF output
  - 16-byte tag


## Encryption
This ECIES variant performs the following steps to produce ciphertext result:
1. A random ephemeral EC key pair is generated for each message
2. A Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed over the **ephemeral private key and the peer (static) public key**. The result is a shared secret.
3. A KDF is used to expand the shared secret into 256 bits of shared information. Apple uses X9.63 KDF which is simply a SHA message digest of the concatenation of the shared secret, a 4-byte incremental counter, and the ephemeral **public** key data which serves as the initialization vector (IV).
4. The first half (128 bits) of the KDF result is used as the symmetric encryption key for AES-GCM, while the second half (128 bits) is used as the nonce. 
5. The output of the encryption process is a concatenation of (in this order):
   - the **ephemeral** public key
   - the output of the AES-GCM function (which itself is just a concatenation of the ciphertext and the message tag)
